This program is a game in which the computer is the one guessing
a number, while the user is responding with either "Too small",
"Too large", or "Correct". Depending on the user's response, the
computer will generate a new number (trying to guess correctly),
or will consider the game over. The game starts (again) using a
"New Game" button.
