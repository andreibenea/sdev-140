Assignment: M06 Practice Programming Exercise 9-5
This program uses a GUI to allow the user to type in a temperature value
inside an input field. This value can represent either degrees Celsius or 
degrees Fahrenheit. Two additional buttons will allow the user to trigger
the conversion of the previously typed in value in the desired counterpart:
degrees C or F.
The program uses the following formula to make the conversion:
F = 9/5 * C + 32
F is the Fahrenheit temperature, and C is the Celsius temperature.
